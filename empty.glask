-- ; xyz _ = takes (given :: (forall x . x -> x)) -- this needs to fail but it DOESN'T !!!
-- IT DOES FAIL NOW
-- it fails, because retyping (given) to a totally polymorphic type is illegal
-- and no longer infers:
-- xyz :: (forall a b . a -> b -> b)

-- it would be a problem for two reasons
-- the one related to contexts is that the function `takes`
-- expects a function that is applied to a single thing
-- but would be given a function that expects also a dictionary before the argument

-- let's try simpler version of it
-- ; xyz'1 _ = (given :: (forall x . x -> x))

-- ; xyz'2 _ = ((given :: Add a => a -> a) :: (forall x . x -> x))

-- ; xyz'3 _ = ((undefined :: Add a => a -> a) :: (forall x . x -> x))
-- fails for the same reason

-- ; xyz'4 _ = (((\ x -> x) :: Add a => a -> a) :: (forall x . x -> x))

-- (undefined :: Add a => a -> a) :: [et -> et]

-- what if the one expecting thinks there will be more dictionaries but the one given expects fewer?

-- ; takes' :: (forall x . Num x => x -> x) -> a -> a
-- ; takes' fnumx a = fnumx a -- I think this will force `a` to be qualified with Num too
-- -- yes, that's what happens
-- -- so it does not type check
-- -- so no problem when dictionary passing
-- 
-- ; given' :: a -> a

-- ; function x = (((\ i -> i) :: forall x . Add x => x -> x) :: forall y . y -> y) -- this should fail to type check
